A captcha alternative for preventing spam on forms, while maintaining an easy interface for humans.

Simply slide the element to the right to submit the form, similar to unlocking an iOS device. (Slide via a mouse drag, or touch!) If a user mistakenly clicks instead, the sliding element will do a little animation to help suggest what to do.

###Usage
Slide To Submit requires jQuery. Add the plugin after jQuery, and initialize it. You may also call options here.

```
<script src="js/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="js/slide-to-submit.js"></script>
<script>
	$('.slide-submit').slideToSubmit({
		errorText: 'Check required fields', // Shown if fields are invalid & browser doesn't have built-in tooltips
		successText: 'Sent!', // Shown before submitting
		submitDelay: 500, // Delay for showing successText
		graceZone: 100 // Pixels from the right that is accepted as a full side
	});
</script>
```

Add the CSS to the header, or include with your other styles:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/slide-to-submit.css">
```

Add the slide-submit element at the end of your form:

```
<form>
  <div class="slide-submit">
  	<div class="slide-submit-text">Slide To Submit</div>
  	<div class="slide-submit-thumb">Â»</div>
  </div>
</form>
```
